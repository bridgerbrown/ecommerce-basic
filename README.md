This is a demo eCommerce project with features such as a database of dynamically updating products, cart functionality, and basic email user authentication.

This project was made using React, NextJS, Firestore database, Firebase user authentication and the art database of the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. The ARTIC has an excellent collection of some of the most renowned pieces and collections which I narrowed down to a few that stuck out to me and were public domain.
